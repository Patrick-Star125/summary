## Are you following your dream

The bestselling book of Bronnie Ware named "The Top Five Regrets Of  The Dying" reveal a significant but easy to overlook fact - if we don't follow our dreams we will definitely feel regret. Most of people get lost in the world of jobs, money, families and careers. But not for everyone.

We'll be hearing how Daisy and Herman made their dreams come true - not by changing the world, but by changing themselves.

**Daisy**

The first dreamer we’re going to meet lives in Riverside, a peace-loving community in New Zealand where everyone shares everything.

"What I think I always believed in is that the sharing of resources can provide a group of people with quite a great advantage, but it doesn’t matter how many hours you work or what work you do, everyone is getting the same amount. And that is something that many people outside of Riverside **struggle with**, and where we’re often getting this ‘communism’ label attached to us, because it’s so… it seems so **outlandish** for people."

**Herman**

Our second group of dreamers are a family - the Zapps.

"I am so happy with the Herman there is now, that I know now – not the one who wanted to **conquer** the world, but the one who was conquered by the world. I learn so much from people, and it’s amazing how the more you meet people, the more you know stories, how much more **humble** you become because you notice that you are a beautiful, tiny piece of sand, but a very important **piece of sand** like everyone is, right?"



**utopia**: perfect, ideal society where everyone is happy and gets along with each other

**struggle with (something)**: find it difficult to accept or even think about (something)

**outlandish**: strange, unusual and difficult to like

**conquer**: control something by force
