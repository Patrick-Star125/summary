And that is something that many people outside of Riverside **struggle with**, and where we’re often getting this ‘communism’ label attached to us, because it’s so… it seems so **outlandish** for people."

**Herman**

Our second group of dreamers are a family - the Zapps.

"I am so happy with the Herman there is now, that I know now – not the one who wanted to **conquer** the world, but the one who was conquered by the world.

In the world of emojis, we can put back the human emotions that's missing in the texts and emails. But not every is an emoji fan. Some people believe that carefully chosen words are the best way of expressing yourself, and that emojis are affecting our ability to put feelings into words.

We will discuss with a cognitive linguist, Professor Vyv Evans, the author of book about the language of emojis about her feeling  toward this opinion.

**Professor Vyv Evans**

A lot of people, you know, language-mavens, **the grammar police** and so on, or say… have this sort of **jaundiced**, prejudiced **view** about emoji - that it's taking us back to **the dark ages** of illiteracy - bring back Shakespeare, and stick to the language of Shakespeare and all the rest of it.

But that fundamentally misunderstands the nature of communication. Emoji is important. In fact, it makes us more effective communicators in the digital age.

Well, there is research that's been conducted by Match.com, the American-based **dating** site, and what they've found, based on their research, is that the people that use more emojis tend to be **lucky in love**, they have more success in terms of **dating**. In the digital age, using emoji makes us more effective communicators, which means we are more expressive to others by using emojis.  We're better able to express our emotional selves, and people therefore **it stands to reason** that if you use more emojis you're gonna get more dates!

**dating **: spending time with someone you have started a romantic relationship

**lucky in love**: lucky in finding a romantic partner

**it stands to reason (that)**: it seems likely to be true (that); it makes sense (that) back to the dark ages

If you occasionally do it and you made it sound a bit more like you do it all the time, that’s more exaggeration – a lot of people do that, where they exaggerate things about themselves to make them seem more attractive. But they’re **walking a fine line** in trying to balance between being attractive and not completely disappointing.
