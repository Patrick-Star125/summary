The line graph **compares** the amount of **electricity produced** in France **using four different sources of power** over **a period of** 32 years.

It is clear that nuclear power was **by far the most important** part of electricity generation **over the period shown**. Renewables provided **the lowest amount** of electricity **in each year**.(highest, lowest)

**ln 1980**, thermal power **stations** were the main **source of** electricity **in France**, **generating** around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced **just under** 75 terawatt hours of electricity separately, and renewables **provided** a **negligible amount**. Just one year later, nuclear power **overtook** thermal **power** as the primary source of electricity.

Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power **rose dramatically** to **a peak of** 430 terawatt hours. **By contrast**, the figure for thermal power **fell to** only 50 terawatt hours in1985, and **remained at** this level for **the rest of the period**. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production **saw only a small rise to** approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.

In 1980, 29% of **an average New Zealand household budget went on** food and drink, while the equivalent figure for a UK home was 23%. **By 2008**, expenditure on food and drink **had fallen by** 4% in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. **By contrast**, both countries saw an increase in expenditure on utility bills for the average home,from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26% to 28% in the UK.

**Leisure** activities **accounted for the highest proportion** of UK household spending in both years, but only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. In fact,in 2008, New Zealanders **spent only half as much in relative terms** on recreation(17%) as UK residents(34%). In both countries,transport costs and other costs took roughly 15% and 10% of household budgets respectively.

The table **compares** the **five highest ranking countries** in terms of **the numbers of visits** and **the money spent by tourists** over **a period of two years**.

It is clear that France was the **world's** most popular tourist destination in the years 2012 and 2013. However, the USA **earned by far the most** **revenue from tourism** **over the same period**.

In 2012, 83 million tourists visited France, and the USA was **the second most visited** country, with 66.7 million tourists. Spain and China each **received** just under 58 million **visitors**, while Italy was **ranked fifth** with 46.4 million tourists. **2013 saw a rise of** between 1 and 4 million tourist visits to each country, with the exception of China, which received 2 million **fewer visitors than in the previous year.**

Spending by tourists visiting the USA increased from \$126.2 billion in 2012 to ​\$139.6 billion in 2013, and **these figures were well over twice as high as** those for any other country. Spain received the second highest **amounts of tourist revenue**, rising from \$56.3 billion to \$60.4 billion, followed by France, China and Italy.

The bar chart compares the numbers of male sand females who **took** four different evening **classes** in 2009, and the pie chart shows the age profile of these attendees.

It is clear that **significantly more** women **than** men attended evening classes at the education central. We can also see that evening courses were much more popular among older adults.

**According to the bar chart**, drama, painting and language **courses all attracted more women** than men to the education central in 2009. Language classes **had the highest number of** participants overall**, with** 40 female and 20 male **students**, while painting was **a popular choice among both genders**, attracting 30 female and 25 male **attendees**. The only course with a higher number of males was sculpture, but this course **was taken by a mere 15 people** in total.

**Looking at the age profile pie chart**, we can see that **the majority of** people attending evening lessons were over 40 years of age. **To be precise**, 42% of them were aged 50 or more, and 26% were aged between 40 and 49.Younger adults were in the minority, with only 11% of **students** aged 20 to29, and only 5% aged under 20.

The first diagram represents the process of glass containers production, and the second diagram shows steps/stages in the process of recycling used glass.(1 sentence)

**We can see** that the glass is made using three main materials, **and that** the manufacturing process consists of four distinct stages. It requires five steps to turn used glass into new glass products. (2 sentences)

At the first stage in the production of glass, sand, soda ash, limestone and other chemicals are mixed together. Next, this mixture is heated in a glass furnace at 1500 celsius to produce molten glass. the molten glass than will be shaped, by blowing, to create the final products, namely glass containers. (3 sentences)

Glass recycling begins with the collection of used glass products. The collected glass is the sorted **according to** its color, and then washed in order to remove any impurities. In the stage 4 process, cleaned glass is crushed and melted, and then the molten glass can finally be moulded to create new items.

The two chars compare current layout of the ground floor of a house with a plan to redesign the living space. 

What we can see that the new proposed plan involves making a number of changes on the certain space, mainly in the central hall area. There are no plans to change external wall or entrance doors.

The most noticeable change from existing design to proposed plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when building work has been done. This will be achieved by removing the internal wall and door between hall and living room, along with the current staircase and under-stair storage cupboard. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room layout will also contain the staircase to the first floor.

To replace the current straight staircase, a new set of window stairs will be installed in the corner of the living room. The internal door between hall and kitchen will be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen and new living room. Finally, the planned building work will also include the installation of some kitchen furniture.

**Map diagram**

(多用位置来填字数)

The map shows the growth of a village called Chorleywood near London between 1868 and 1994.

It is clear that village grew as the transport system development. Specifically, four periods of development are shown in the map, and each populated areas are near to the main roads, the railway or the motorway.

From 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood covered a small area near to the main roads. Chorleywood park and Golf course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main roads to the south between 1883 to 1922. Within the period in 1909, the railway was built across the map from west to east, and Chorleywood station is in this part of village.

The expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development took place around the motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.

Governments in some countries spend **large amounts of money** on **space exploration programmes**. I **completely agree with** the idea that **these are a waste of money**, and that the **funds** should **be allocated** to public services.

**There are several reasons** why space programmes should **be abandoned**. Firstly, it is extremely expensive to train scientists and other staff **involved with** **space missions**, and facilities and equipment also come at **a huge cost to** the government. Secondly, these programmes do not benefit normal people in our daily lives; they are simply **vanity** projects for politicians. Finally, many missions to space fail completely, and the smallest technological error can cost astronauts lives. The Challenger space shuttle disaster showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and **in my opinion** it is not worth the risk.

I believe that **the money** from space programmes **should go to** vital public services instead. It is much cheaper to train doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or the scientists and engineers who work on space exploration projects. **Furthermore**, public servants do jobs that have a **positive impact on** every member of society. For example, we all **use** schools, hospitals and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide. If governments reallocated the money spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people could **be lifted out of poverty** or **given a better quality of life**.

In conclusion, my view is that governments should spend money on services that benefit **all members of society**, and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not **improve our everyday lives.**

**Discussion**

**People have different views about whether** children should be taught to be **competitive** or **co-operative**. **While** a spirit of competition can sometimes be useful in life, **l believe** that the ability to co-operate is more important.

**On the one hand**, competition can be a great source of **motivation** for children. When teachers use games or prizes to introduce an element of **competitiveness** into lessons, it can encourage children to work harder to **outdo** the other **pupils** in the class. This kind of **healthy rivalry** may help to build children's self confidence, **while** pushing them to work independently and progress more quickly. When these children leave school, their confidence and determination will help them in competitive situations such as job interviews. **It can therefore be argued** that competition should be encouraged in order to prepare children for adult life.

**On the other hand**, it is perhaps even **more important** to prepare children for the many **aspects** of adult life **that require co-operation.** In the workplace, adults **are expected to** work in teams, follow instructions given by their **superiors**, or supervise and support the more **junior members of staff**. **Team collaboration skills** are much more useful than **a competitive determination** to win. This is the attitude that **l believe** schools should **foster** in young people. **Instead of** **promoting** the idea that people are either winners or losers, teachers could show children that they could gain more from working together.

In conclusion, **l can understand** why people might want to **encourage competitiveness** in children, but **it seems to me** that a **co-operative attitude** is much more **desirable** in adult life.

**problem and solution**

**It is true that** the behavior of school **pupils** in some parts of the world **has been getting worse(have severe problems)** in recent years. There are **a variety of** possible **reasons** for this, but **steps can definitely be taken** to **tackle the problem.**

In my opinion, three main **factors(reasons)** are **to blame for** the way young pupils behave at school nowadays. Firstly, modern parents are **tend to** be too lenient or permissive. Many children **become accustomed to getting** whatever they want, and they find it **difficult to** accept the demands of teachers or the **limits imposed on them** by school rules. Secondly, if teachers cannot control their students, there **must be** an **issue with the quality** of classroom management training or support within schools. Finally, children **are influenced by** the behavior of celebrities**, many of** whom **set the example** that success can be achieved without **finishing school.**	

Students **behaviour** can certainly be improved. **I believe that the change must be start with(Firstly)** parents, who need to be **persuaded** that it is important to **set firm rules for** their children. When children misbehave or break the rules, parents should use **reasonable** punishments to demonstrate that **actions have consequences.** Also, schools could **play an important role in** training both teachers and parents to use effective disciplinary techniques, and in improving the **communication between both groups.** At the same time, famous people, such as musicians and football players, need to understand the responsibility that they  have to **act as role models** to children.

In conclusion, schools will **continue to face** discipline **problems** unless parents, teachers and public figures **set clear rules** and **demonstrate the right behaviour** themselves.

**Two-part question**

![](http://pic.netpunk.space/images/2022/12/27/20221227123035.png)

**It is true that** editors have to make difficult decisions about which news stories they broadcast or publish, and their choices are no doubt influenced by a variety of factors. In my opinion, **we are exposed to** too much bad news, and **I would welcome** a greater emphasis on good news.

Editors face a range of **considerations** when **deciding** what news stories to focus on. Firstly, I imagine that they have to consider whether viewers or readers will be interested enough to choose their television channel or their newspaper over competing providers. Secondly, news editors have a responsibility to inform the public about important events and issues, and they should therefore prioritise stories that are in the public interest. Finally, editors are probably under some pressure from the owners who employ them. For example, a newspaper owner might have particular political views that he or she wants to promote.

**It seems to me** that people do become **accustomed to** negative news. We are exposed on a daily basis to stories about war, crime, natural disasters and tragic human suffering around the world. I believe that such repeated exposure gradually desensitises people, and we become more cynical about the world and more sceptical that we can do anything to change it. I would prefer to see more positive news stories, such as reports of the work of medical staff after a natural disaster, or the kindness of volunteers who help in their communities. This kind of news might inspire us all to lead better lives.

In conclusion, it must be **extremely difficult** for editors to choose which news stories to present, but I would like to see a more **positive approach** to this vital public service.
