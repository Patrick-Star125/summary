### Work or Home

 **Do you work or are you a student?**

I am a college student, I am currently studying at GuiLing university of electronic technology and my major is software engineering.

**Tell me about where you live**

Now I am living in an apartment  



### 喜好类表达

Well to be honest, in general I would say that **I'm actually quite keen on**（第1种喜欢表达）animals, but in particular I would mention that **I'm really into**（第2种喜欢表达）domestic pets like dogs. And I guess the reason why **I'm quite a fan of**（第3种喜欢表达）dogs is because **I simply adore**（第4种喜欢表达）their companionship and loyalty. **Whenever** I arrive home seeing my dog, **I'm filled with joy** and comfort.

### 讨厌类表达

For the most part, I think I'd have to say that **I'm not so keen on**（第1种讨厌表达）the weather. To be specific, **I really can't stand**（第2种讨厌表达）the summer months. This is mainly because the temperature can get as high as 40 degrees and **I find it extremely unpleasant**（第3种讨厌表达）. It can be quite uncomfortable if you don't have air conditioning in your house.

### 频率类表达

Well to be honest, I think I would have to say that **it really depends.** **For example, if** I have the money, **then** it's quite possible that I will watch a movie in the cinema two or three times a month. **You know** cinema tickets are pretty pricey in China. But **if** I'm broke, it's more likely that I'll watch movies at home on DVD; **you probably know that** DVDs are quite cheap here, especially compared to the price of a cinema ticket.

### 是非类表达

**按性质比较**

Well in fact, If I think about it, I guess that in many ways **it's essential**（肯定正面观点）, especially when you consider that a healthy diet can help to prevent a variety of diseases and health problems such as diabetes and obesity（解释原因）. But you also need to understand that eating unhealthy food *in moderation*（适度地）**is not overly harmful**（缓和反面观点）. In fact, unhealthy food is often tastier than healthy food, so I guess it's fine to eat a little junk food now and then（解释原因）.

**按人比较**

Well, case by case（视不同情况而定）. On the one hand, I think getting married is more important to women, meaning that they often want to start a family, have children and so on. || On the other hand, men have bigger fish to fry（男人有更重要的任务）! The reason behind is that they have to concentrate on their career and climb the corporate ladder（事业晋升）!





## Part2

> Type 1：城市/建筑类（City）
> Type 2：人物类（Person）
> Type 3：组织类（Organisation）

> Type 6：自然类（Nature）
> Type 7：动物类（Animals）
> Type 8：抽象类（Abstract Topics）

Part 2只有一个话题，发言时间是1-2分钟，是考生的**一人独角戏**。讲满两分钟，拖得越长越好

## Others
