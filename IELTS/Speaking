In my school, there's a significant rule regarding motorcycles on campus. The rule states that every motorcycle on the **premises** needs to have a valid pass, and this pass can only be applied for during certain periods of the year.

When people break this rule, it can lead to the result that their motorcycles might be temporarily **impounded**. This rule aims to control the total number of motorcycles on campus and maintain a safe traffic environment.

I think it's an important rule for a couple of reasons. First, it helps reduce traffic jams within the school, especially during **peak hours**. With limited parking spaces, having too many motorcycles can make it chaotic and unsafe. Second, it promotes responsible vehicle ownership. People need to ensure their bikes are in good condition and meet the required safety standards to get a pass.

Personally, I appreciate this rule because it means I can get to school more easily without getting stuck in a traffic mess.

In general, I believe it's a rule that serves the greater good and makes our campus a safer and more pleasant place.

A few months ago, I had this really frustrating experience with my computer. It happened in college when I was trying to finish up a major project. My laptop was my lifeline for research and writing, so you can imagine how stressful it was.

The problem was that my computer would auto shutdown almost immediately after I turned it on. It was driving me crazy because I had no idea what was causing it. I thought it might be **some software issue**, but after some investigation, I realized it was a hardware problem.

I narrowed down the issue to either the battery or the hard disk. It took a bit of **troubleshooting** and research online, but I finally figured out that it was probably the hard disk overheating. It was a really unusual problem, but I didn't want to give up.

So, I decided to switch the positions of the two disks in my laptop, thinking it might help reduce the temperature of the one that was causing the issue. It was a bit **nerve-wracking** because I didn't want to mess things up even more, but it worked! By making that simple change, the overheating issue was resolved. This experience taught me a lot about troubleshooting computer problems.

The issue started when I received the wrong order. I had ordered a classic Margherita pizza, but they brought me a seafood pizza instead. I don't like seafood, and to make things worse, the pizza had an unpleasant, **overly salty flavor**.

When we informed the server, they **offered to** replace the pizza, but we had already waited for a very long time, and the **prospect of more waiting** was unappealing. So, we decided to cancel our remaining orders and left.

I felt terrible about the whole experience. It was **meant to be** a delightful evening with friends, but it turned into a frustrating and disappointing one. I expected better service and food quality, and the restaurant failed to deliver. This experience left me not only disappointed but also a bit **frustrated**.

My professor spoke highly of its rich history and unique architecture, and I was instantly intrigued. You see, **Hangzhou** is well known for its West Lake which is a mesmerizing place with stunning views, almost like a painting.

The city is also home to many historic landmarks like the **Ling yin Pagoda** and **Lion Temple**, which are absolutely captivating. These structures clearly echo the brilliance of ancient Chinese architecture and tradition.

The city isn't just a historical treasure trove, though; it's also the hub for e-commerce in China, being the headquarters for **Alibaba**, one of the world's largest e-commerce companies. So it bridges the gap between past and present beautifully.

I mean, it's not every day you find a city that showcases such an impressive mix of tradition and innovation, right?

Moreover, it was built over a period of many centuries through different Chinese dynasties, which I think is a testament to the incredible **perseverance** of the Chinese people. The Great Wall is not only a place of **historical significance**, but it's also a symbol of China's **rich cultural heritage**.

I guess the reason why I'm so interested in the Great Wall mainly **lies in** its historical and cultural significance. Every single brick in the wall tells a story about China's past, its strength, and struggles.

It symbolizes the spirit of unity and **perseverance**, traits that **resonate** with me deeply as a Chinese student. Moreover, I'm always amazed by the fact that it was built without the aid of modern **machinery**. This makes me curious to learn more about the techniques that were used back then.
