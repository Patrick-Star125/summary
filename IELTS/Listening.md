## Advices

* 雅思达到一定分数**以后**，刷雅思题的意义不大，不如按照雅思官方的建议，去广泛听听你不熟悉的材料。

### 学会同义替换

* 听完每套真题的时候，注意总结S3和S4中的同义替换，时间允许的话，S2中的同义替换也总结一下。S1中因为太简单了，所以就不用特意反复听。
* 总结同义替换：左侧写出材料题干中的词，右侧写听力中听到的同义替换的词。最好能找到一一匹配的关系。这个步骤一个Section的耗时应该半个小时到一个小时左右，比你完全练逐字逐词的精听要节省很多时间，意义也大很多。

### 学会总结弱点

* 错误归类，例如：拼写错误、单复数错误、没听懂、没听到、若干个选项都听到了，但是最后选错了

  * 这几类问题最好解决的a，把听力语料库听个几次，错词集中整理一下，考前看两眼。
  * b单复数错误：解决方式是听力做完一套题以后，用一个小时左右，把Section3放3遍，Section4放3遍，把所有听到的名词写下来，然后再和听力原文核对，没有听出来的复数多听几遍，总结一下自己没有听到这个复数的原因。
  * c没听懂：如果句子里面用的句型或者某些词你没有听懂，还有几个子原因。
  
    * c-1 生词：如果是专业名词，不用过分注意。但是常规名词，请找个小本本好好记一下。
  * c-2 句子语法听不懂：语法不过关的同学，请找老顾小白书或者其他语法课程，巩固一下语法。
    * c-3 有些连读没有听出来：连读听不出来的，可以专门找一些连读的课程听听。基本上连读规律很简单的，一两个小时内就可以把这事解决了。
  * d没听到：需要提高判断出题点的能力，同义改写还是要多练练。
  * e选项都听到，最后选错：注意总结一些常见的否定表达。
* 分类练习
  * 在做过一定量的真题以后，可以结合自己常见的错题集中练习。例如，如果你多选题和Section4不擅长，也可以批量练习。在小站雅思PC端的页面上，可以批量练习。
* 加速练习
  * 无论听什么材料都是1.5X速，这样在考场的时候，基本上都是在等选项的感觉，淡定异常。但具体加速多少不强求，如果你在1.25X速时比较舒服，也是OK的。Anyway，不建议平时练习的时候仍然保持1倍速。
* 保持节奏
  * 即便你想考8分，你也是有4道错题的机会。换句话说，如果在练习过程中，出现没有听到的题，没有把握的题，不要过分沉浸，尽快跟上下一道题。

> 基本上过了8分的选手，一味地刷真题意义不大了。根据雅思官方的考试建议，也是建议你多去听听自己不熟悉的话题。比如对于Section4的动物种类不是很熟悉，就可以听听英语类的动物介绍。有一个Youtube上的动画片叫Wild Kratts，可以拓展这类知识。

I had seen a couple of people doing it prior to that but then, you know, I kind of did it in a way that was a bit funny, maybe **cracked** a couple of **jokes** around the ways - or maybe not so great ways - some people were doing things at the time and that video just **took off.**”

**Rammal Mehmud**

Our first beauty influencer from Pakistan is `Rammal Mehmud`. She has popular Instagram and YouTube accounts on which she shares content to help women with their confidence and mental health. Let's see what she told to our reporter:

### Are you following your dream

The bestselling book of Bronnie Ware named "The Top Five Regrets Of  The Dying" reveal a significant but easy to overlook fact - if we don't follow our dreams we will definitely feel regret. Most of people get lost in the world of jobs, money, families and careers. But not for everyone.

We'll be hearing how Daisy and Herman made their dreams come true - not by changing the world, but by changing themselves.

**Daisy**

The first dreamer we’re going to meet lives in Riverside, a peace-loving community in New Zealand where everyone shares everything.

"What I think I always believed in is that the sharing of resources can provide a group of people with quite a great advantage, but it doesn’t matter how many hours you work or what work you do, everyone is getting the same amount. And that is something that many people outside of Riverside **struggle with**, and where we’re often getting this ‘communism’ label attached to us, because it’s so… it seems so **outlandish** for people."

**Herman**

Our second group of dreamers are a family - the Zapps.

"I am so happy with the Herman there is now, that I know now – not the one who wanted to **conquer** the world, but the one who was conquered by the world. I learn so much from people, and it’s amazing how the more you meet people, the more you know stories, how much more **humble** you become because you notice that you are a beautiful, tiny piece of sand, but a very important **piece of sand** like everyone is, right?"



**utopia**: perfect, ideal society where everyone is happy and gets along with each other

**struggle with (something)**: find it difficult to accept or even think about (something)

**outlandish**: strange, unusual and difficult to like

**conquer**: control something by force 

**humble**: not proud or arrogant

**a grain of sand**: small and insignificant, yet at the same time important, part of a whole



### Do emojis make language better

Emojis were invented in 1999 in japan for the first internet-enable mobile phone, now they have become a part of our communication. In the world of emojis, we can put back the human emotions that's missing in the texts and emails. But not every is an emoji fan. Some people believe that carefully chosen words are the best way of expressing yourself, and that emojis are affecting our ability to put feelings into words.

We will discuss with a cognitive linguist, Professor Vyv Evans, the author of book about the language of emojis about her feeling  toward this opinion.

**Professor Vyv Evans**

A lot of people, you know, language-mavens, **the grammar police** and so on, or say… have this sort of **jaundiced**, prejudiced **view** about emoji - that it's taking us back to **the dark ages** of illiteracy - bring back Shakespeare, and stick to the language of Shakespeare and all the rest of it.

But that fundamentally misunderstands the nature of communication. Emoji is important. In fact, it makes us more effective communicators in the digital age.

Well, there is research that's been conducted by Match.com, the American-based **dating** site, and what they've found, based on their research, is that the people that use more emojis tend to be **lucky in love**, they have more success in terms of **dating**. In the digital age, using emoji makes us more effective communicators, which means we are more expressive to others by using emojis.  We're better able to express our emotional selves, and people therefore **it stands to reason** that if you use more emojis you're gonna get more dates!



**the grammar police**: (informal) people who want to have correct English spelling and grammar written online, and who criticise those who don't follow grammar rules

**a jaundiced view (of something)**: only seeing the negative side of something because of your own bad experience with it

**the dark ages**: a time in the past considered not advanced and characterised by a lack of knowledge and progress

**dating **: spending time with someone you have started a romantic relationship

**lucky in love**: lucky in finding a romantic partner

**it stands to reason (that)**: it seems likely to be true (that); it makes sense (that) back to the dark ages



### English for online dating

Nowadays, many people use dating app to find love and romance. This involves writing a dating profile, a short description of yourself which you hope makes you appear attractive to other people looking for love online. But as always within information found on the internet, there is danger that someone's dating profile doesn't tells the truth. In the common sense of dating profile lying, we will learning some of the newest phrases used in online dating. Dr Nicola Fox Hamilton will teach us in the interview：

**Dr Nicola Fox Hamilton**

“If you’re very **deceptive**, so if you have no friends, and you never go to the pub, and you said in your profile that your most fun thing to do is **hanging out** with your friends on a Saturday night, then that becomes a problem because then you’ve been very deceptive. If you occasionally do it and you made it sound a bit more like you do it all the time, that’s more exaggeration – a lot of people do that, where they exaggerate things about themselves to make them seem more attractive. But they’re **walking a fine line** in trying to balance between being attractive and not completely disappointing.

**Catfishing** is when someone tries to be more attractive by creating a false profile and pretending to be someone else on social media. Related to this is the term, **wokefishing**. Here someone asks about your political and social opinions, and pretends to share them in order to get closer to you. They may pretend to have more liberal or progressive attitudes than they really do.”



**deceptive**: making you believe something that is not true

**hanging out**: spending a lot of time with someone, often friends

**walking a fine line**: finding a balance between opposing ideas, or between two sides so as not to annoy either side

**catfishing**: trying to attract someone by pretending to be someone else on social media

**wokefishing**: pretending to share the same political and social opinions as a person that you are attracted to
